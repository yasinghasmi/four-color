# SSL Certificate Renewal Script
# This script simulates SSL certificate renewal and returns success or failure

echo "Starting SSL certificate renewal process..."

# Simulate SSL renewal process
# Replace this section with your actual SSL renewal commands
# For example: certbot renew, acme.sh, or other SSL tools

# EXAMPLE: Uncomment one of the following lines to simulate success or failure

# Simulate SUCCESS - uncomment this line for testing success scenario
echo "SSL certificate renewed successfully!"
exit 0

# Simulate FAILURE - uncomment this line for testing failure scenario
# echo "ERROR: SSL certificate renewal failed!"
# exit 1

# ACTUAL SSL RENEWAL COMMANDS WOULD GO HERE
# Examples:
# certbot renew --quiet
# /root/.acme.sh/acme.sh --renew-all
# your-ssl-renewal-command-here

# Check the exit code of your SSL renewal command
# if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
#     echo "SSL certificate renewed successfully!"
#     exit 0
# else
#     echo "ERROR: SSL certificate renewal failed!"
#     exit 1
# fi
